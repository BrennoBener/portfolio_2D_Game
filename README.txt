# Developer portfolio that's a 2D game

By studying javascript projects, i found this on the freeCodeCamp courses.
here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-developer-portfolio-as-a-2d-game/

Inspired by the many creative 3D developer portfolios, I create one that's 2D instead.
This is meant as a template that you can use to build your own. It works on both desktop
and mobile.
